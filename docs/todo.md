# Implementation Todo

This file tracks the gap between **written specs** and **written code**. Every item here corresponds to a section of a spec's implementation plan. When an item is completed, check it off and note the commit or PR.

Items are ordered by dependency — earlier items unblock later ones. Within a component (server, iOS, Android), the order follows the implementation plan in each spec.

---

## Server (Go)

Spec: [`specs/server/spec.md`](specs/server/spec.md)

- [ ] **Hash matcher** — Constant-time comparison via `crypto/subtle`, return matched label (REQ-S-2). Currently uses O(1) map lookup which is not timing-attack resistant.
- [ ] **Rate limiter** — Token bucket per device_id, 429 + Retry-After response (REQ-S-6). Not yet implemented.

---

## iOS Mobile App (Swift)

Spec: [`specs/mobile-app/spec.md`](specs/mobile-app/spec.md) → Implementation Plan — iOS

- [ ] **Debug image capture** — Save to sandbox, delete on toggle off (REQ-M-20)
- [ ] **Memory audit** — Verify < 200 MB RAM, buffer reuse (REQ-M-31)
- [ ] **Privacy audit** — Verify no plaintext in logs, no analytics SDKs, no image export in production (REQ-M-40, REQ-M-41, REQ-M-43)
- [ ] **App icon** — Add 1024×1024 PNG to `AppIcon.appiconset`
- [ ] **Development team** — Set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` to Apple Team ID (requires Apple Developer account)
- [ ] **App Store Connect listing** — Screenshots, description, privacy policy URL, category, age rating
- [ ] **TestFlight build** — Archive and upload for beta testing

---

## Android Mobile App (Kotlin)

Spec: [`specs/mobile-app/spec.md`](specs/mobile-app/spec.md) → Implementation Plan — Android

- [ ] **Debug image capture** — Save to app-internal storage, delete on toggle off (REQ-M-20)
- [ ] **Memory audit** — Verify < 200 MB, bitmap recycling (REQ-M-31)
- [ ] **Privacy audit** — No plaintext leaks, no analytics, ProGuard rules (REQ-M-40, REQ-M-41, REQ-M-43)

---

## E2E Testing

Spec: [`specs/testing.md`](specs/testing.md) → E2E Testing, [`specs/mobile-app/test-scenarios.md`](specs/mobile-app/test-scenarios.md) → E2E Tests

- [ ] **CI integration** — Run E2E tests in GitHub Actions with emulator + Docker

---

## Future

- [ ] **Investigate backgrounding iOS** — Revisit whether any App Store-safe, user-visible iOS mode can relax the foreground-only camera requirement without violating Apple's background camera restrictions.

---

## Productionizing

- [x] **Change the pepper** — Replaced `default-pepper-change-me` with a secure random value in root `.env` as single source of truth. Server reads via env var, iOS generates `Pepper.swift` at build time, Android injects via `BuildConfig.PEPPER`.
- [ ] **Enable SSL** — Configure TLS for the server. Railway provides automatic HTTPS via its proxy, but update mobile app `SERVER_BASE_URL` to use `https://` and ensure `DATABASE_URL` uses `sslmode=require` for the Postgres connection.
- [ ] **Redis subscriber store** — Replace the in-memory `subscribers.Store` with Redis-backed storage so subscriber state survives server restarts and scales across multiple instances.
